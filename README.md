# face-mask-detector-system
The end of 2019 witnessed the outbreak of Corona virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has continued to be the cause of plight for millions of lives and businesses even in 2020. As the world recovers from the pandemic and plans to return to a state of normalcy, there is a wave of anxiety among all individuals, especially those who intend to resume in person activity. Studies have proved that wearing a face mask significantly reduces the risk of viral transmission as well as provides a sense of protection. However, it is not feasible to manually track the implementation of this policy. Technology holds the key here. We introduce a Deep Learning based system that can detect instances where face masks are not used properly. Our system consists of a dual stage Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture capable of detecting masked and unmasked faces and can be further integrated with pre-installed CCTV cameras. This will help track safety violations, promote the use of face masks, and ensure a safe working environment.
